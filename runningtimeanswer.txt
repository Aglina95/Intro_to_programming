If you don't know what the sorted running(or any other methods) time is, just write that the program has the running time of the sorted 

Quadratic = O(n^2)
Constant = O(1)
Linear = O(n)
Logarithmic = O(logn)

#if you don't remember how to write a method, put the text from the exercise description to indicate what this method should do
#by opening files you also get points
#They ver ask for constant, linear or logarithmic when asking about difficulty in running time
