#Think of the names of your three favorite pizzas.
#Store these pizza names in a list. Find an appropriate name for the list yourself.
#Use a for loop to print the name of each pizza one by one.

#favorite_pizzas = ["pineapple", "special", "bacon"]
#for pizza in favorite_pizzas:
    #print(pizza)

#Modify your for loop to print a whole sentence instead of just printing the name of the pizza.
#For each pizza, you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like
#pepperoni pizza (if the list contains the element 'pepperoni').

favorite_pizzas = ["pineapple", "special", "bacon"]

for pizza in favorite_pizzas:
    print('I like ' + pizza + ' pizza!')
