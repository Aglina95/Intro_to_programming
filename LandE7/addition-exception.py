# Write your code here :-)
'''10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number.'''

try:
    num_1 = input("Enter a number ")
    num_1 = int(num_1)

    num_2 = input("Enter another number ")
    num_2 = int(num_2)

    addition = num_1 + num_2

    print(addition)

except ValueError:

    msg = "I am sorry! This is not a number!"
    print(msg)
